Hi @%{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).
Currently, it is marked as a VBScript repo since more than 50% of its code is identified as [VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub-Automations/main/assets/vbs-file-extension.svg">

The reason is that you are currently using the extension `.vbs` for your VBA code, but this extension is associated with VBScript.

To solve this issue and make sure that files in this repo are correctly identified as VBA, there are a mainly **3 options**:

## Option A: Change the file extensions to `.vba`

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub-Automations/main/assets/vba-file-extension.svg">

By using the `.vba` extension, you make sure that all you VBA code will be correctly detected by GitHub as VBA.


## Option B: Add the following in the `.gitattributes` file:

```gitattributes

*.vbs linguist-language=vba

```

The advantage of this method is that you only have to make the change in one place. The disadvantage is that this won't solve the problem for GitHub searches because the `linguist-language` attribute is not supported for searches. This means that if the VBA language filter is used in a search query, files that are currently labeled as VB.NET still won't show up.


## Option C: Change the file extensions to `.bas` + add some information at the top of each file

The `.bas` extension is the default extension for VBA modules code, but it is also shared by other languages in the BASIC family of languages. To avoid any ambiguity, it is better to include the following information at the top of your `.bas` files:

```vba
Attribute VB_Name = "ComponentName"
'@Lang VBA
```

The `Atttribute` is automatically generated by the VBE when you export a VBA module and the `@Lang` annotation is there to make sure your code isn't indentified as Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) by mistake since VB6 module files also have `Attribute VB_Name` at the top. You can also automate the process of adding the  `@Lang` annotation with the [BASIC-Language-Annotation Action](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/BASIC-Language-Annotation).
