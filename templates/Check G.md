Hi @%{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).

Currently, if people try to download your repo as a .zip file (or if they try to clone your repos without specific git settings), they will have a bug if they try to import `.cls` or `.frm` files in the Visual Basic Editor (VBE). That's because these downloaded files would have Unix-style line endings (LF) instead of what the VBE expects: Windows-style line endings (CRLF):

%{ls_files_report}%

The issue is that your repository doesn't have a `.gitattributes` file to tell other machines how to handle  end-of-line (EOL) characters. In this case, GitHub servers are likely Unix sytsems and they don't perform EOL conversion by default. Note that this would also affect Windows systems that clone your repo without automatic conversion turned on (`core.autocrlf=true`).

# How to fix this?

You need to create a `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository to handle VBA file line endings properly. There are mainly 2 options:

## Option 1: Enforce CRLF in the Index (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository

```gitattributes
# VBA extensions: Prevent LF normalization
*.bas  -text
*.cls  -text
*.frm  -text
```

### Step 2: Restore CRLF line endings in the Git Index.

Here are 2 methods you could use to do that:

#### Method A:

If you still have the original files exported from the VBE in your working directory and you are able to use Git from the command line, you can simply run the following 2 commands:

```bash
git add . --renormalize
git commit -m "Restore line endings"
```

#### Method B:

You could also simply use [Enforce-CRLF](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/Enforce-CRLF) which will make sure to enforce CRLF in your repo for all the current files and will also prevent LF from being introduced by mistake in the future.

## Option 2: Convert to CRLF at checkout

⚠️ Warning: this approach will solve the line endings issue when people try to clone or download your repo as .zip, but it will not fix line endings if people try to download a single raw file.

To keep LF in the Index and only perform CRLF conversion at checkout, create a `.gitattributes` file with:

```gitattributes
*.bas  text eol=crlf
*.cls  text eol=crlf
*.frm  text eol=crlf
```
