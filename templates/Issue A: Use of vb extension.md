Hi %{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).
Currently, it is marked as a Visual Basic .NET repo since more than 50% of its code is identified as VB.NET.

<img height="100px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub-Automations/main/assets/vb-file-extension.svg">

The reason is that you are currently using the extension `.vb` for your VBA code, but this extension is associated with VB.NET.

To solve this issue and make sure that files in this repo are correctly identified as VBA, there are a mainly 3 options:

## A. Change the file extensions to `.vba`

By using the `.vba` extension, you make sure that all you VBA code will be correctly detected by GitHub as VBA.


## B. Add the following in the `.gitattributes` file:

```gitattributes

*.vb linguist-language=vba

```

The advantage of this method is that you only have to make the change in one place. The disadvantage is that this won't solve the problem for GitHub searches because the `linguist-language` attribute is not supported for searches. This means that if the VBA language filter is used in a search query, files that are currently labeled as VB.NET still won't show up.


## C. Change the file extensions to `.bas` + add the language information at the top of each file

The `.bas` extension is the default extension for VBA modules code, but it is also shared by other languages in the BASIC family of languages. To avoid any ambiguity, it is better to include the following information at the top of your `.bas` files:

```vba
Attribute VB_Name = "ComponentName"
'@Lang VBA
```

The `Atttribute` is automatically generated by the VBE when you export a VBA module and the `@Lang` annotation is there to make sure your code isn't indentified as Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) by mistake since VB6 module files also have `Attribute VB_Name` at the top.
