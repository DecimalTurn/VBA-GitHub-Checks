Hi @%{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).

Currently, it is not marked as a VBA repo because the files that contain your VBA code don't have a file extension.

To solve this issue and make sure that files in your repo are correctly identified as VBA, you could simply add the file extension `.vba` to your file(s).

By using the `.vba` extension, you make sure that all you VBA code will be correctly detected by GitHub as VBA and you also get syntax highlighting of you code making it easier to read.
