Hi @%{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).

Currently, the .gitattributes file is misconfigured and there is a risk that if people try to clone or download your repo as a .zip file, they will get an error due to line endings in .cls or .frm files.

Here's a simple solution:

<h2>Step 1: Add this to your `.gitattributes`</h2>

```gitattributes
# VBA extensions: Prevent LF normalization
*.bas  -text
*.cls  -text
*.frm  -text
```

<h2>Step 2: Restore CRLF the line endings in the Git index.</h2>
<h3>Option A:</h3> 
If you still have the original files exported from the VBE in your working directory and you are able to use Git from the command line, you can simply run the following 2 commands:

```bash
git add . --renormalize
git commit -m "Restore line endings"
```

<h3>Option B:</h3>
You could also simply use [Enforce-CRLF](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/Enforce-CRLF) which will make sure to enforce CRLF in your repo for all the current files and will also prevent LF from being introduced by mistake in the future.

For more information on how to configure your .gitattributes file and why you don't want to set the `text` property for VBA files, you can have a look at https://github.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub.

And if you have any questions, feel free to ask it here and a real human will answer you.
