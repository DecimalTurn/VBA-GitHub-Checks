Hi @%{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).

Currently, the .gitattributes file is misconfigured and there is a risk that if people try to clone or download your repo as a .zip file, they will get an error due to line endings in .cls or .frm files.

For more information on how to configure your .gitattributes file, you can have a look at https://github.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub.
