Hi @%{user}%,

It seems like there is a small issue with your repo named [%{reponame}%](%{url}%).

Currently, the .gitattributes file is misconfigured and there is a risk that if people try to clone or download your repo as a .zip file, they will get an error due to line endings in .cls or .frm files.

Here's a simple solution:

Step 1: Add this to your `.gitattributes`

```gitattributes
# VBA extensions: Prevent LF normalization
*.bas  -text
*.cls  -text
*.frm  -text
```

Step 2: Restore CRLF the line endings in the Git index.
To do that, you can do a git add + commit like this (Option A):

```bash
git add . --renormalize
git commit -m "Restore line endings"
```

Or you could also use [Enforce-CRLF](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/Enforce-CRLF) which will prevent LF from being introduced by mistake in the future as well (Option B).

For more information on how to configure your .gitattributes file and why you don't want to set the `text` property for VBA files, you can have a look at https://github.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub.

And if you have any questions, feel free to ask it here and a real human will answer you.
